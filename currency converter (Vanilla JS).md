üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application follows these steps:

User Input: The user enters the amount to convert and selects the base and target currencies.

API Request: Upon clicking "Convert", the JavaScript code makes a fetch request to the ExchangeRate-API, using the base currency as a reference.

Calculation: The exchange rate for the target currency is extracted from the API response and used to calculate the converted value.

DOM Display: The formatted result, exchange rate, and last update time are dynamically displayed on the page.

üì∏ Conversion Examples
